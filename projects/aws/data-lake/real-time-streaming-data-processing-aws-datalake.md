## Project name: AWS DATA LAKE - Multiple approaches conbined

|   |   |
|---|---|
|  ***Data Ingestion*** |  As a Cloud Engineer , you are assigned with a task to setup required infrastructure for a Small Business in Azure Cloud. | 
| ***Business Case***  |  A Small Business Grocery shop 'DailyFresh' is new in town. As the name says, they deliver fresh vegetables to door steps based on the order they receive through their website. Every morning the traffic is expected to be very high (users more than 1000) for grocery order. after noon it is expected less than 100 visitors on website<br> The owner of the business has hired you as Cloud Engineer to setup the nacessary IT insfrastructure in Cloud to run this business |
|  ***Approach 1*** | <li> All infrastructure must be in Canada region only <li> Data should not be stored out side of Canada |
|  ***Requirement*** | ***Setup Organization*** <br> <li> Setup Organization hierarchy, Tenants, Management Group , Subscription. <li> Create two Users. One for application development. Another for managing Billing , Assign Roles, Enable MFA for every users <br><br> ***Setup Policy*** <br> <li> User passpord must be alphanumeric with minimum 15 max 25 length <li> Password Should be changed in every 90 days <li> Passord should not match last 5 passowrd <li> No user should be able to login with out MFA <li> Every resource must have tags project, costcenter, createdby <br><br> ***Budget*** <li> Monthly budget should not exceed $20 <li> It should alert when 80% of busget is reached  <br><br> ***Infrastructure*** <li> Create a custom vnets of CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 <li> Create two subnets in  vnet by equaly diving the ip range <li> Create azureBastionHost in one subnet <li> Create a linux VM in other subnet <li> Create a security group which will allow SSH access from bastion host only. and HTTP from public internet <li> Install httpd in VM <li> Create index.html and deploy in apache webserver <li> Setup autoscaling. It should increase instance +1 when CPU usage goes more than 70%. <li> Create a load balancer to balance the traffic between VMs  <br><br> ***Monitoring and Observability*** <li> Create a dashboard to show Network In and Out traffic trend <li> CPU utilization <li> No of storage accounts <li> No of VMs <br><br> ***Backup*** <li> Create backup of the VM in snapshot in daily frequency. <li> Keep last 2 backup only|
